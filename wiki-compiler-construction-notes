### 0 Intro

So, we're dealing with syntax, how we use characters to represent an 'element',
grammar, the ways in which we are allowed to combine elements to make valid
combinations, and semantics, the expression of what we want to achieve, using
the combination of the aforementions elements.

### 1 Compiler

A compiler simple converts one language to another.  It determines the
correctness of the syntax, generates correct and efficient object code, 
performs run-time organisation and formats the output according to 
assembler and/or linker conventions--whatever all that exactly means.
